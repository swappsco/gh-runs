# üìÑ gh_actions_queue.sh

This Bash script helps manage **cancellable GitHub Actions workflow runs** (`queued` and `in_progress`) for a specific repository or an entire GitHub organization using the GitHub CLI.

It can:

- List cancellable workflow runs
- Cancel up to a defined number of them
- Run in **dry-run** mode for safety
- Output detailed logs with `--debug`

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated
- `jq` installed
- `bash` (compatible with most POSIX shells)

---

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
./gh_actions_queue.sh <target> <action> [limit] [--debug] [--dry-run]
```

## üß™ Examples

### List cancellable runs for a repo

```bash
./gh_actions_queue.sh swappsco/dejusticia list

```bash
./gh_actions_queue.sh swappsco/dejusticia cancel
```

### Cancel up to 50 for an organization (all repos)

```bash
./gh_actions_queue.sh swappsco cancel 50
```

### Preview cancel actions without actually cancelling

```bash
./gh_actions_queue.sh swappsco cancel 50 --dry-run
```

### Combine dry-run and debug

## üßæ Output

At the end, the script prints a summary like this:

```
üìã Repositories with cancellable runs:

```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Only `queued` and `in_progress` workflow runs are considered cancellable.
- The GitHub CLI must be authenticated with appropriate access to the repos.
- If using org-wide mode, ensure your token has visibility into all relevant repositories.
